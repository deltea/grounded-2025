## Development Logs

### getting started! - August 11, 2025 <a id="getting-started!-2025-08-11"></a>

**Time Spent:** 2h 0m

#### What I Did

created a new project and started to work on the basic design for the pcb!

#### Issues Faced

i'm wondering which color i should use for the board... black looks super sleek, but i kinda hate how there isn't a gray color. the blue one has a darker shade of blue, which is nice, but it looks a bit more generic. i think i'm probably gonna go with black, since it fits my website.

#### Next Steps

i'm going to add more decoration on the front side of the card

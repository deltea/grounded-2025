# ðŸ’³ pcb business card

this my very own personalized pcb business card that links to my website when tapped!

## sunday 8/10

created a new project and started to work on the basic design for the pcb! i quickly finished making the schematic, and i'm wondering which color i should use for the board... black looks super sleek, but i kinda hate how there isn't a gray color. the blue one has a darker shade of blue, which is nice, but it looks a bit more generic. i think i'm probably gonna go with black, since it fits my website.

added a cool starry background on the nfc tag. i made the background with inkscape, and added some meteors and big stars.
i also added some memes on the back, along with a persona quote
oh and also, i went with black
